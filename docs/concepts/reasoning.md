## Overview

The reasoning engine is the cognitive core that processes information, draws inferences, and generates logical conclusions. It combines multiple reasoning paradigms to handle diverse problem types.

## Reasoning Types

### Symbolic Reasoning
**Purpose:** Logic-based inference using formal rules

**Characteristics:**
- Rule-based systems
- Logical inference
- Deterministic outcomes
- Explainable reasoning chains

**Use Cases:**
- Formal logic problems
- Rule-based decision making
- Structured reasoning tasks

### Neural Reasoning
**Purpose:** Pattern-based inference using learned representations

**Characteristics:**
- Pattern matching
- Learned associations
- Probabilistic outputs
- Handles ambiguity

**Use Cases:**
- Natural language understanding
- Visual reasoning
- Pattern recognition tasks

### Causal Reasoning
**Purpose:** Understand cause-effect relationships

**Characteristics:**
- Causal models
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Intervention analysis
- Causal discovery

**Use Cases:**
- Understanding consequences
- Planning interventions
- Explaining outcomes

### Analogical Reasoning
**Purpose:** Transfer knowledge from similar situations

**Characteristics:**
- Similarity matching
- Knowledge transfer
- Abstract reasoning
- Creative problem solving

**Use Cases:**
- Novel problem solving
- Learning from examples
- Creative solutions

## Architecture Components

### Inference Engine
- Processes reasoning tasks
- Selects appropriate reasoning type
- Generates reasoning chains
- Validates conclusions

### Knowledge Integration
- Combines information from memory
- Integrates multiple knowledge sources
- Resolves conflicts

- Detects errors
- Improves reasoning over time

## Key Research Questions

1. How do we combine symbolic and neural reasoning?
2. What enables effective causal reasoning?
3. How do we enable analogical transfer?
4. What meta-reasoning mechanisms improve performance?
5. How do we scale reasoning to complex problems?
